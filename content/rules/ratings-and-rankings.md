Kuruso uses d6:6 dice measured by **tier** and **degree**, each from 1--6. Tiers measure major
ranks. Degrees measure difference within those ranks. When rolling a d6:6, the first die or the die
closest to the player is the tier die, the other is the degree die.

Tiers have **rankings**:

- The 1st tier is nominal (**N**),
- the 2nd tier is basic (**B**),
- the 3rd tier is comprehensive (**C**),
- the 4th tier is extraordinary (**E**),
- the 5th tier is incredible (**I**),
- the 6th tier is unbelievable (**U**).

d6:6 numbers are **ratings** and have two digits separated by a colon. A rating of `3:5` is a tier
of `3` with a degree of `5`.

Ratings increase by degree then by tier. 3:5 precedes 3:6 then 4:1.
