To decide how a character's action plays out, answer the following questions, discussing as
necessary.

1. **Intent:** What does the character want?
1. **Approach:** Hows does their character try to achieve that intent?
1. Can the approach for the intent succeed? If not, the character fails.
1. Can it fail? If not, the character succeeds.
1. Does failure have meaningful consequences? If not, the character succeeds. If so, the character
   must test.

In short, a character must test if and only if their approach to their intent can succeed and can
fail with meaningful consequences.

## Tests

When a test is called for, follow this order of operations, stopping when the result is clear:

1. The adjudicator decides which attribute (Iron, Flax, or Bone) is the most relevant to the
   character's approach.
1. The adjudicator determines the difficulty tier of the test based on the character's approach and
   the current context. Most tests are tier 1.
1. The player states a relevant domain to use for the test, if any.
1. The player rolls d6:6.
1. If the roll's rating is 6:6, the result is a botch, the worst possible outcome for the
   character's intent by their approach.
1. If the roll's rating is equal to the rating of either the relevant attribute or applicable
   domain, the result is a triumph, the best possible outcome for the character's intent by their
   approach.
1. If the tier of the roll's rating is less than the tier of the difficulty, the result is a
   failure.
1. If the roll's rating is under the rating of either the relevant attribute or applicable domain,
   the result is a success.
1. If the degree of the roll's rating is less than the tier of the applicable domain, the result is
   a success.
1. The result is a failure.

## Contests

Contests are tests with more than one party, like a race, negotiation, or fight. Contests follow the
same order of operations as normal tests until every side's result is determined. Then, follow this
order of operations to determine the result of the contest:

1. If only one party succeeded or triumphed, they win the contest.
1. If more than one party triumphed, the triumphing party with the highest rolled rating wins the
   contest.
1. If more than one party succeeded, the succeeding party with the highest rolled rating wins the
   contest.
1. If every party failed, the party with the highest rolled rating wins the contest.
