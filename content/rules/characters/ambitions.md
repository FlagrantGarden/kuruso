  Rules for defining characters in Kuruso.

Ambitions drive the people of Kuruso to new heights, manifesting in their thoughts, actions, and
eventually their very being as the world's magic recognizes their efforts.

Ambitions may be long-term, only achievable with seasons or years of dedicated effort, or
short-term, attainable in the next few hours or days. Fulfilling ambitions changes a person
figuratively and literally as their tephra responds to their manifested will.

Characters may have up to two active long-term ambitions and one short-term ambition at a time.

## Short-Term Ambitions

Short-term ambitions are always declared during play.

When a character achieves a short term ambition, mark the attribute (iron, flax, or bone) most
relevant to it with a `+` or erase an `x`. If a character fails in their short-term ambition, mark
it with an `x` or erase a `+`.

## Long-Term Ambitions

Long-term ambitions drive at what a character wants to become. Unlike short-term ambitions,
long-term ambitions have a rating and are a relevant domain while pursuing that ambition. As a
character advances towards their ambition, they may unlock related knacks.

The list of ambitions below is non-exhaustive.

### Become an Ironbinder

Ironbinders are the rare folk in Kuruso who have mastered the use of precious iron to bind eldritch
entities to their will, turning daemons into servants or destroying them with mere speech. They are
marked by the rust in their sweat and tears and the iron tokens they wear as talismans, etched with
the old words.

When you embark on the journey to becoming an ironbinder, gain the Ironbinder domain with a rating
of 1:1. This domain is relevant for tests to identify, research, interact with, and defeat daemons,
as well as speaking the Old Tongue.

Whenever you survive physical contact with a daemon, test this domain. If successful, you learn the
daemon's name. Whether or not you succeed, mark the domain.

When you know the name of six daemons, you gain the Irontongue knack.

When the rating of your Ironbinder domain reaches tier 3, you gain the Rustful Humors knack and are
eligible to undergo the Iron Trial, where you will be given the name of a daemon to bind as your
own servant by another Ironbinder. If you succeed, you ascend as a full Ironbinder in your own
right.

Irontongue
: The stronger this knack, the stiffer and darker your tongue becomes, hardening in your mouth to
  living iron, coated in rust from your saliva. Unless polished and cleaned, the difficulty tier
  for all speech when not exercising this knack is increased by its magnitude.

  Exercise this knack to speak with daemons. Your words transform in your throat to the Old Tongue,
  granting you power over them. Social tests against daemons can damage their tephra as if attacking
  them with a weapon.

Rustful Humors
: The stronger this knack, the more obvious your calling. All of your bodily fluids stain with rust,
  streaking from your pores and orifices. Your hunger for flesh, especially organs, increases.

  Exercise this knack convert your own blood to tephra at a 2:1 rate, pulling iron and power from
  your body.
