Everyone has skills, which define an area of expertise a character has practiced.

Skills are domains rated by tier and degree. A character may have any number of skills. New skills
begin with a rating of 1:1.

Skills are free-form descriptors of a domain. Some skills are specializations within a field, like
fighting styles or driving a specific vehicle.

> Todo: Describe different skill specializations and why narrow might be better than general?
> Alternatively, don't care.
