  Rules for defining characters in Kuruso.

---

Everyone has a vocation, a calling that guides their life along a course of mastery. Some folk even
have several, feeling the pull of differing destinies.

Vocations are domains rated by tier and degree. A character may only follow as many vocations as the
tier of their Flax attribute. New vocations begin with a rating of 1:1.

A character may abandon a vocation. If they do, it degrades at a rate of one degree per week. If it
is being abandoned in favor of a related vocation, the rating can instead be transferred at a rate
of one degree per day of dedicated study or practice.
