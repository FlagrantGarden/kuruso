Reputations are more of a currency in Kuruso than any precious metal or precious jewel. They are
statements or adjectives about characters that other people may believe. They don't necessarily
represent an inherent truth about a person.

Reputations are domains rated by tier and degree. A character may have any number of reputations.
New reputations begin with a rating of 1:1.

The first time a reputation might be relevant when interacting with a person or a faction, make an
iron test with the reputation as the relevant domain. If successful, the other party believes the
reputation. Don't test for the reputation again with that party until its rating changes.

If the other party believes in a characters reputation, social tests between the character and that
party have their difficulty reduced by the reputation's tier if it's applicable.

Characters can reinforce or disabuse others of their reputations by their actions and by cultivating
the reputation intentionally.

When a character takes an action that can be observed or recorded that would reinforce the
reputation, mark it with a `+` or erase an `x`. When the action would disabuse others of the
reputation, mark it with an `x` or erase a `+`.

To cultivate a reputation, spend wealth equal to the reputation's current tier to add or erase a
mark as desired, buying rumors or art to spread or alter their reputation.

Characters can also gain new reputations in play when their actions would create one or they choose
to intentionally cultivate it.
