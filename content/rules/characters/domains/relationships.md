Everyone in Kuruso is tied to other people and factions by the threads of their relationships.
Formal relationships go further, conferring advantages and disadvantages, recognized by both the
parties and the very magic of the city.

Relationships are special domains rated by tier and degree. A relationship takes one of several forms:

- Alliances are formal relationships between two people or factions promising to aid and defend
  each other.
- Guardianships are are formal relationships between two people, one promising to take care the other.
- Nemeses are formal relationships between two people or factions promising to hinder and thwart
  each other.
- Memberships are formal relationships between a person and a faction, the person promising to
  serve the faction and observe its tenets, the faction to provide services and support to the
  member.

All formal relationships confer advantages and disadvantages. They can also be directly invested in.

## Alliances

Advantages
: Test to compel an ally to loan an appropriate item, service, or finances, to assist in a plot, to
  vouch for you, or to provide information or employment.

  You only need to use this mechanism if the ally would otherwise be disinclined to help you. If you
  are successful, they render aid without complaint. If you fail, mark the relationship with an `x`
  or erase a `+`.

Disadvantages
: Allies can compel you in the same way you can compell them. Further, nemeses of your ally treat
  you as a nemesis.

Investing
: Invest in your alliance by giving gifts of wealth or service. When you do so, mark the
  relationship with a `+` or erase an `x`.

Formalizing
: Formalize an alliance by spilling each other's blood into a ritual bowl and igniting it with both
  parties tephra, burning as many points as the initial tier of the alliance's rating.

Breaking
: Unilaterally break an alliance by formally resigning and giving gifts worth six times as much as
  the tier of the relationship. Mutually break an alliance by sundering the ritual bowl together,
  burning tephra equal to the tier of the relationship.

## Guardianships

Advantages
: Count your relationship as a relevant domain for any test when fulfilling your duty as a guardian.
  You may test to draw tephra from your ward, pulling up to the degree of a successful test from
  their own body. If you fail, you still draw the tephra but mark the relationship with an `x` or
  erase a `+`.

  If you are the ward, you may compel your guardian to protect or provide for you. You only need to
  use this mechanism if your guardian would otherwise be disinclined to help you. If you are
  successful, they render aid without complaint. If you fail, mark the relationship with an `x` or
  erase a `+`.

Disadvantages
: The guardian is responsible for the ward's wellbeing. They must provide the basics for the ward's
  existence, including food, shelter, and employment. If they fail in these duties, their tephra is
  reduced by one per day until they make amends. If their tephra is reduced to 0, their blood burns
  away instead. Further, wards may be targeted by nemeses since the relationship is public record.

Investing
: Guardians may invest in their relationship by giving gifts of wealth to their ward. Wards may
  invest by rendering services to their guardian. When you do so, mark the relationship with a `+`
  or erase an `x`.

Formalizing
: Formalize a guardianship by providing all of the material needs for the ward for a month in
  advance and swearing an oath on your own blood and tephra to provide for them, burning one point
  of each. You must have at least three public witnesses and record the relationship by signing each
  other's flesh.

Breaking
: Break a guardianship by denouncing the other before three witnesses and burning tephra equal to
  the tier of your relationship. If the witnesses judge that the reason is invalid, the loss of
  tephra is permanent.

## Nemeses

Advantages
: Count your relationship as a relevant domain for any test when thwarting your nemesis. You may use
  your nemesis relationship in place of an alliance to compel your enemies of your nemesis to aid
  you against them.

Disadvantages
: Nemeses may compel your enemies to join with them and are particularly effective at thwarting you.
  You are obligated to oppose your nemesis. When you consciously choose not to do so, mark the
  relationship with an `x` or erase a `+`.

Investing
: Invest in your nemesis by giving gifts and services to their enemies, publicizing their failures
  and flaws, or thwarting their plans. When you do so, mark the relationship with a `+` or erase an
  `x`.

Formalizing
: Formalize your status as nemeses by mutually and ritually denouncing each other in public. To
  denounce your enemy, carve their name into a lead bullet with your fingernails, wet the bullet
  with your blood, and throw it into the Well of Feuds.

  If the denouncement isn't mutual, you gain the benefits of nemesis but only for six days, after
  which the relationship is sundered if you don't burn tephra equal to the tier of the relationship
  at every moonfall.

Breaking
: Break your relationship as nemeses by publicly reconciling and retreiving the bullet you cast from
  well.

## Memberships

Advantages
: Gain access to all factional facilities and services up to the tier of your relationship.
  Membership is a prerequisite to supplication.

  You may test to compel the faction to provide you with information, supplies, or employment.

  You only need to use this mechanism if the faction would otherwise be disinclined to help you. If
  you are successful, they render aid without complaint. If you fail, mark the relationship with an
  `x` or erase a `+`.

Disadvantages
: You must perform any favors the faction asks of you. If you refuse, mark the relationship with an
  `x` or erase a `+`.

  Further, the faction's enemies treat you as an enemy.

Investing
: Invest in your faction by giving gifts of wealth or service. When you do so, mark the relationship
  with a `+` or erase an `x`.

Breaking
: Break your relationship by relinquishing all rights and obligations to the faction. If this is
  unilateral, it may be permanent, shutting the member off from the faction for all time.
