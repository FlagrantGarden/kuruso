Iron, Flax, and Bone are the three fundamental attributes all creatures and characters in Kuruso
share. They define the base goal when adjudicating actions. Each attribute has a rating between 1:1
and 6:6. For humans, the average for these three attributes is 2:4.

## Iron

In Kuruso, iron is a precious rarity. Any magic effects are more potent when iron is incorporated
in the application and demons shy away from the metal that ignores their abilities and defenses.
Iron represents a character's force of will, presence, and metaphysical aptitude. When someone is
heavy with iron, they're powerful personally and magically, a noticeable presence in any room. If
they're light on iron, they may slip by unnoticed or unremarked.

## Flax

Flax represents so much of human ingenuity, supplying them with food, oil, cloth, paper, and paint.
In Kuruso, it symbolizes ingenuity, industry, trade, craft, and knowledge. Flax
represents a character's mental prowess and training, including their knowledge and intuition. When
someone is stuffed with flax, they're knowledgeable and well trained, able to apply their knowledge
in all sorts of situations. If they're meager with flax, they lack training and education and have
to rely on their more limited direct experience and first-hand knowledge to see them through.

## Bone

In Kuruso, capacity for danger and hard work are both symbolized by the bone that bears them. Bone
represents a character's physical prowess and training, including their strength, endurance,
agility, and hand-eye coordination. When someone's strong-boned, they're fast, powerful, flitting
from danger to danger with ease and grace. When they're brittle-boned, they are unable to overcome
strenuous physical obstacles, having to rely on their other resources to get things done.
