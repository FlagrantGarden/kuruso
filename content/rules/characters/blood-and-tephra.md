## Blood

In Kuruso, the thickness of someone's blood is as a metaphor for how tough they
are, or how much danger seems to affect them. People who are thick-blooded stride through dangers
recklessly, surviving dangers that turn lesser folk into memories. But blood thins fast, even for
would-be heroes, leading to terrible wounds and death.

A character's blood is calculated as the sum of the tiers for their iron and bone. A week of rest
thickens the blood by one tier, up to its natural thickness.

## Tephra

In Kuruso, those who are hot with Tephra are intrinsically powerful or adept at magic, manifesting
as warmth emanating from their flesh. Truly gifted folk make the very air around them shimmer with
their power. Using their tephra cools them, sometimes to death. When folk run out of tephra, they
must resort to spending the warmth in their blood instead.

A character's tephra is calculated as the sum of the tiers for their iron and flax. A day of rest
warms the tephra by one tier, up to its natural temperature.
